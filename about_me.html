            Hello hello hello everyone, my name is Venom and I'm assuming since you are reading this, you find me at least moderately interesting,
            which I will take as a compliment since I don't receive many of those. All of the things I talk about here will eventually be made
            into full posts. But until then, here's a little bit about me: <br>
            <br>
            <strong class="title">My high school robotics team was really cool:</strong> <br>
            During high school, I was a part of a robotics team called "Lake Monsters Robotics" and their team number was '2635'.
            As the only fun part of school, we built 125 lbs. robots that would complete various tasks around a field about the size
            of a basketball court and compete with other teams across the state (somtimes across the world). If I'm honest,
            I would say I would not be interested or included in the things I do right now if it not for my robotics team.
            That also goes for the teams I had applied for; if I were to do it all over again, 1) I would try and be involved more
            than I was and 2) I wouldn't have batted an eye at the other FTC Teams. For that and other reasons, I feel indebted
            to my team. One of the best things they taught me was mistakes are ok to make so long as you learn from them, which has
            helped me out immensely, especially in recent times. <br>
            <br>
            <strong class="title">Living with ADHD:</strong> <br>
            I can't say it's great, I also can't say it's terrible. In my vast experience living with ADHD, it has both helped
            and hindered me to an incredible degree. It's very intuitive during creative activities, but very limiting anywhere
            else. Notice how I didn't say 'applying', that's because there is no off switch, which is the number 2 reason why it sucks.
            You might be asking yourself, "What's the number 1 reason?" Well the answer is quite simple: people not understanding
            what day-to-day life is like. <br>
            <br>
            <strong class="title">Attempting to be a Content Creator:</strong> <br>
            It has been really hard for me to actually make anything on YouTube or Twitch for a multitude of reasons, but mainly
            because of my parents. I was very unmotivated to do anything like choosing and making a project, script, film, edit,
            and make a thumbnail. I've always wanted to be a Content Creator because it looks like and is a fun job, plus you
            can even get paid for it. So much so, that 3 years ago, I tried streaming on Twitch after school to attempt to amass
            viewers. I would stream for a couple hours a few days a week playing Cluster Truck. I wouldn't get more
            than 2 viewers, chat was empty, and my setup was hot garbage, but I still had a lot of fun doing it. I ended up
            discontinuing my short streams because my parents existed. <br>

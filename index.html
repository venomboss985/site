            I have created my own brand new website. Please keep in mind, I am by no means a web design specialist,
            nor am I a web developer, so don't go too hard on me as this is my first attempt at making a website,
            which is why the right third of the screen is blank if your screen is large.
            Half of the pages don't exist yet, there's no special scripting,
            and there isn't anything on the backend, but eventually, things will be updated.

                    While the links page is down, go ahead and check out my YouTube channel; I only have 1 actual video (this one)
                    a few memes, but I have some projects I am working on and should be posted there soon.<br>
                    Thanks for visiting it anyways.

                    The 'About Me' page on this website is the only other page that works,
                    so if you want to check it out, go back up to the nav menu in the top left
                    and click on 'About Me' to learn more, well, about me. <br>

                    This is an improvisational piece I made. The entire video is uncut
                    footage of me learning to improv scales (which is why it sounds bad
                    in the beginning). It was fun to make, so I might make more of these
                    in the future.
